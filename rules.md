# Rules

Degens bets will either pay out completely to the winner or be settled at the [cancellation price](/protocol?id=finalization-prices). The cancellation prices for each market can be seen by clicking on the "i" icon next to the market type.

Cancellation of all markets on an event will occur in any of the following cases:

* Cancelled or abandoned by league/organizers for any reason
* Event start time postponed or moved to a different day
* If an event is suspended before it is completed and is not resumed within 24 hours
* Any other material changes to the match details
* Sport-specific cancellation reasons (see below)

The scores used for finalization must be **final** scores. If an event is suspended mid-game (and not resumed as described above), all markets are cancelled, even markets like already-reached totals.

## Soccer

* **Full-time results only**: The scores used are taken after 90 minutes of regulation plus stoppage time. Does **NOT** include extra added time or penalty kicks.

## American Football

* Includes over-time scores
* Money-line bets are settled at the cancellation price in the event of a tie

## Basketball

* Includes over-time scores

## Hockey

* Includes over-time goals
* Penalty shoot-outs are considered part of over-time. The winner is credited with an extra goal, and this extra goal **does** count towards the final score

## Baseball

* Any pitching changes will not affect a bet.
* Extra innings count toward all bets.
* If a game venue is changed then bets will action providing the home team is still designated as such. If the home and away team for a listed game are reversed, then bets placed based on the original listing will be deemed no action.
* The game must go at least 9 full innings (or 8½ innings if the team batting second is ahead) for bets to have action.
* If the game is called after the necessary amount of innings for a bet to action has been reached, then the winner is determined by the score after the last full inning (unless the team batting second scores to tie or takes the lead in the bottom half of the inning, in which case the winner is determined by the score at the time the game is called).

## Boxing/MMA

* Money-line: A win is any victory recognized by the offical organizers. This includes Knockout, Technical Knockout, Opponent Retired, Unanimous/Split/Majority/Technical Decision, and Opponent Disqualified. A draw will result in the money-line match being settled at the cancellation price.
* Initially announced results are final. Subsequently overturned decisions will not affect finalizations.

## E-sports

* Money-line is the winner of the match.
* For spreads and totals, the number being bet on is the number of games or maps won. For example, in a best-of-3 match, the Total would be 2.5 and represents whether or not a third game is played.

## Table Tennis

* Money-line is the winner of the match.
* For spreads and totals, the number being bet on is the number of games won.

## Politics

### US Presidential Election 2020

In this market "Trump" refers to the incumbent president Donald Trump, and "Field" refers to any other candidate.

This market will be settled according to the candidate that has the most projected Electoral College votes after conclusion of the 2020 US presidential election. The use of the word "projected" is only to emphasize that any subsequent events such as a ‘faithless elector’ will have no effect on the settlement of this market. In the event that no Presidential candidate receives a majority of the projected Electoral College votes, this market will be settled on the person chosen as President in accordance with the procedures set out by the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

In the event of any ambiguity over the election results, Degens reserves the right to delay grading until we are confident that the election result will not change. Degens reserves the right to delay the grading until a President of the United States is sworn into office on or after January 20th, 2021.
